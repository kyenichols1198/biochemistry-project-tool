    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Biological switches are fundamental to cellular memory. Responses to\n",
    "changes in regulating enzymes has different responses on various\n",
    "cellular pathways. In this case, a positive feedback transcriptional\n",
    "pathway can be affected by activator regulation. Perturbating positive\n",
    "feedback can create distinct states, which could be described as\n",
    "“tunable dynamics” in the picture.\n",

    "\n",
    "Different signal levels, or perturbations in the cellular environment\n",
    "can create various responses in activity. In this study, sequestrating\n",
    "the activator signal level demonstrates different ranges of sensitivity.\n",
    "Bistable switches can be described as ultrasensitivity where cells are\n",
    "either in one state or the other. In other words, activity is very\n",
    "sensitive at certain ranges of sequestration or perturbation. *However,\n",
    "the requirements for cellular memory aren’t completely understood*.\n",
    "Specifically, no one has definitively shown that sequestration and\n",
    "positive feedback is enough to build a bistable switch, which is the\n",
    "focus of the paper, “Sequestration-based bistabilty enables tuning of\n",
    "the switching boundaries and design of a latch”. In this study, bistable\n",
    "switches were implemented by an activator exhibiting positive feedback\n",
    "and a sequestering anti-activating molecule. An outline of the model,\n",
    "mad in [Biorender](https://biorender.com/) is shown below:\n",

    "Their sequestration-based switch was modeled in E. coli using plasmids\n",
    "derived from Bacillus subtilis which encoded the anti-activator and\n",
    "activator molecules, rsiW and sigW respectively. Changes in these levels\n",
    "were reported by fluorescent proteins contained within these plasmids.\n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers set out to verify that sequestration and positive\n",
    "feedback is sufficient to build a bistable switch. This contrasts\n",
    "previously described models in which cooperativity has been studied as\n",
    "the main source of ultrasensitivity. To test the “tunabilitiy” of their\n",
    "model switch, they systematically perturbed Anhydrotetracycline (aTC)\n",
    "and Arabinose (Ara) levels to induce “on” and “off” states.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Modelling Approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The modeling details of the researchers’ simulated memory unit was\n",
    "described as shown below. *The equation represents the rate of change of\n",
    "total sigma factor concentration in terms of anti-sigma factor and\n",
    "several parameters*. The authors reduced their analytical model by\n",
    "making the **following assumptions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  the rate of transcription must be slower than protein binding. This\n",
    "    is much like the quasi-state approximation where the rate of\n",
    "    formation and dissociation of enzyme binding is slower than product\n",
    "    formation upon substrate binding.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Gene expression is controlled only by the transcriptional activator\n",
    "    and anti-activator sequestration.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Molecule degradation occurs at the same rate amongst all well-mixed\n",
    "    molecules.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Molecule numbers are continuous, and the system is deterministic\n",
    "    rather than stochastic as it would be in reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{\\text{dx}}{\\text{dt}} = basal + V\\frac{free\\_ sigma\\_ factor}{K_{m} + free\\_ sigma\\_ factor} - \\gamma*x$$\n",
